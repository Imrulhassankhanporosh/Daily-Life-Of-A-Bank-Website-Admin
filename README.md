# Web Automation By Selenium Project_2
This is another Selenium project that was created using the page object model (POM), page factory, and running my test cases using TestNG.

I have used a bank website where admins can login and perform necessary responsibilities.

# Features :
1. Login as Admin.
2. Create new customers.
3. Edit the Customers.
4. Add new accounts.
5. Edit accounts.
6. Delete accounts.
7. Deposit money to an account.
8. Withdraw money from an account.
9. Fund transfer from one account to another.
10. Delete cusotmers.
11. Logout.

**N.B** : 

I have implemented the alert handling, dropdown value locate, mouse action, and various locators, and as it was a dummy website,
so the location of the web elements may vary next time, so I provided a screen recording of my Selenium project running.
